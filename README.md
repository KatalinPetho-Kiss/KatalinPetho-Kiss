ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KatalinPetho-Kiss
I am a Senior Research and Data Analyst in the field of international security. 
Originally, I am a solicitor, later I graduated from the Master of Research Program in Policing, Intelligence and Counter Terrorism at Macquaire University in Sydney Australia as an Endeavour Scholarship recipient. 
I did the Google Data Analytics Course in 2021. 
As a counter terrorism practitioner, I have conducted numerous terrorism-related research projects. 
I am keen to publish my theoretical findings in peer-reviewed academic journals (for more information https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8297-2521). 
Through research and collaboration, I am eager to bridge academic, business and practitioner perspectives in the field of international security. 
ðŸ‘€ I am always seeking for new project opportunities and am polishing my coding and data analytical skills. -
